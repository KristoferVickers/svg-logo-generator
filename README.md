## Description

When opening the intergrated terminal within the index.js file and running node index.js. A series of questions will pop up. Follow the prompts and it will generate a shape that is a certain color of your choosing with 3 random letters inside the middle of the shape. The letters will also be a certain color based on your choosing. I have ran this test multiple times it will give you what you want everytime and have no problems doing it. This project was all around very fun to do. Started off kinda shaky but as I got going it really was a lot of the same code from the mini project. 


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for text

THEN I can enter up to three characters

WHEN I am prompted for the text color

THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I am prompted for a shape

THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square

WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color

THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts

THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`

AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line

WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser

THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
